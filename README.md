## Development

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This will run tests in the `tests/` directory.

### Format

Code should like everywhere the same, for this reason a code-formatter is mandatory.

```bash
npm run format
```

### Linter

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Diagnostics

Diagnostic tool that checks for following:

-   Unused CSS
-   Svelte A11y hints
-   TypeScript compiler errors

```bash
npm run check
```
