        Now that you've downloaded the SDK, it's time to initialze it. Use your project ID, which
        can be found in your project settings page.

        has network access to your Appwrite project's hostname or IP address.

                When connecting to a locally hosted Appwrite project from an emulator or a mobile device,
                you should use the private IP of the device running your Appwrite project as the hostname
                of the endpoint instead of localhost. You can also use a service like ngrok to proxy
                the Appwrite server.
